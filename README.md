## Projects

Carbon Calculator

This is a simple carbon footprint calculator. There are others that exist but they tend to suck. The goal with this one is to make it quick to use, easy to share, and accurate in round numbers.

Data used in the calculator
- [World Bank DataBank](https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=2&series=EN.ATM.CO2E.PC&country=#) and [my version cleaned up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gi12hsUF3t9HGNSbQN83m2f9lcr_GxSOy2oS_5kzhsY/edit?usp=sharing)
- [UC Berkeley CoolClimate](https://coolclimate.berkeley.edu/data) and [my version cleaned up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/197CPcF3-P73tup8LQjixdN5snP2kDqTGDX7bX6VwfUI/edit#gid=0)
